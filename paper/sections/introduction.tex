\section{Introduction}
Efficiently automating air traffic management is increasingly important (increased volume and diversity, environmental concerns, etc.).


Quantum annealing is a promising computational method.

We investigate the feasibility of applying quantum annealing to a particular problem in air traffic management known as ``deconficting'', in which the goal is to modify a set of independently optimal trajectories in a way that removes conflicts between them while minimizing the cost of doing so.
