\section{Quantum Annealing}
In this section we report on our efforts to solve problem instances from the departure delay model from section \ref{sec:departure_delay_model} with a D-Wave 2X quantum annealer.
We restricted ourselves to instances with $d_\text{max}=D_\text{max}=18$ and $\Delta_d \in \{3, 6, 9\}$.
\subsection{Embedding}
In order to make a QUBO amenable for a D-Wave 2X quantum annealer, it has to obey certain hardware constraints.
For instance the connections between the binary variables are restricted to the so called Chimera graph \footnote{Reference to Chimera graph}.
However, it is possible to map every QUBO to another QUBO which obeys the Chimera architecture while increasing the number of binary variables used by a so called minor-embedding technique \footnote{Reference to minor-embedding}. 

\begin{table}[htpb]
    \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    $\Delta_d$ &    3 &    6 &    9 \\
    \midrule
    Number of flights $N_f$   &   13 &   19 &   50 \\
    Number of conflicts $N_c$ &   27 &   47 &  104 \\
    Number of logical qubits  &   91 &   76 &  150 \\
    Average number of physical qubits &  631 &  395 &  543 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters of the largest embeddable instances for the D-Wave 2X}
    \label{tab:embedding}
\end{table}

We found, that non of the instances were suitable for direct calculation on the D-Wave machine.
Therefore we used D-Wave's heuristic embedding algorithm \footnote{Reference to D-Wave embedding algorithm} to embed instances with up to $N_f=50$ and $N_c=104$ depending on discretization (cf.\ table \ref{tab:embedding}).
In figure \ref{fig:number_of_physical_qubits} on can see the dependence of the number of physical qubits on the number of logical qubits.

\subsection{Success Probability}

             The error bars indicate the standard deviation.
             We used $10000$ annealing runs for each instance and penalty weights $\lambda = \lambda_\text{conflict} = \lambda_\text{unique} \in \{0.5, 1, 2\}$.
