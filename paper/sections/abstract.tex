In this paper we present the mapping of air traffic management (ATM) problem on
quadratic unconstrained boolean optimization (QUBO) problem. 
After the
representation of the ATM problem in terms of a conflict graph, where nodes of
the graph represent flights and edges represent a potential conflict between
flights, we proceed by discretize the ATM problem and then mapping it in binary
variables. 
As part of our study, we tested the QUBO formulation of the ATM
problem using both classical solvers and the D-Wave 2X quantum chip.
