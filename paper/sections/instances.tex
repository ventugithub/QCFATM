\section{Instances}
To assess our methods on realistic instances of the problem, we use the actual wind-optimal trajectories for transatlantic flights on July 29, 2012, as was done in previous work~\cite{rodionova16}.
In these trajectories, each flight $i$ has a constant (cruising) altitude 
and constant speed, to within (classical) machine precision,
though our methods generalize to instances without these special properties.

To investigate the problem we consider each flight as a vertex of a graph and each conflict between two flights as an edge of this graph.
The connected components of this \emph{conflict graph} represent natural subsets of the problem.
