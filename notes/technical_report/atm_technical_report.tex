\section{Preprocessing of the Trajectory Data}
In the delay only model, a potential conflict is defined by both involved flights, the minimum and the maximum of the time differences of the involved trajectory points 
\footnote{See \url{https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/qcfatm/browser/notes/delay_only} for details}
.
We used the raw trajectory data
\footnote{from \url{https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/qcfatm/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/20120728-29-trajectories.zip}}
for July 29, 2012.
For the delay only model we consider a maximum departure delay of 18 minutes. 
A spatial conflict is real if temporal difference is below 3 minutes.
Therefore we consider a spatial conflict a potential conflict if the temporal difference is below 21 minutes.

    \caption{Two connected components of the conflict graph. The connected components or partitions are label by increasing number of flights involved. Partition 41 involves $N_f=11$ flights and $N_c=40$ conflicts. Partition $49$ involved $N_f=148$ flights and $N_c=513$ conflicts. The thickness of the edges indicates the minimum absolute value of the time difference between trajectory points in conflict $|\Delta t|_\text{min}$. Subsequent point conflicts are grouped together as parallel conflicts. If a pair of flights has both point and parallel conflicts the corresponding edge is marked as a mixed conflict.}
    \label{fig:pre_connected_components}
\end{figure}

The precalculation yields 3663 potential conflicts between 889 flights.
In order to identify possible subsets of the problem, we inspect the conflict graph: Each edge in the conflict graph indicates one or more potential conflicts between two flights which are represented by the graph vertices.
The natural subsets of the conflict graph are the connected components.
Two examples of these connected components of the conflict graph are shown in figure \ref{fig:pre_connected_components}.
Figure \ref{fig:pre_connected_components_statistics} displays statistics of the 51 connected components.
The number of flights and conflicts involved is very high for a few connected components and fairly low for most of the connected components.

\subsection{Multiple conflicts between two flights}
For each pair of flights, more than one conflict may occur (see figure \ref{fig:pre_overlapping_time_intervals}).
There are 441 of 3183 pairs of flights with more than one conflict.
But only 45 of these 441 pairs of flights have non-overlapping time intervals.
For the delay only model, one could merge the conflicts for the other 397 pairs of flights.
\begin{figure}[htpb]

    \caption{Top: Number of conflicts between pairs of flights. Bottom: Maximum gap sizes between non-overlapping conflict time intervals}
    \label{fig:pre_overlapping_time_intervals}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pre_flight_pair_with_two_conflicts} shows an example of a pair of flights with two conflicts.
The two conflicts ($k=69$ and $k=70$) are between flights $i=10$ and $i=12$.
For the first conflict $k=69$ the time interval reads $[-8, -1]$ and for the second conflict $k=70$ it reads $[1, 7]$.

    \label{fig:pre_flight_pair_with_two_conflicts}
\end{figure}

In contrast, figure \ref{fig:pre_flight_pair_with_five_conflicts} shows a pair of flights with five conflicts.
The time interval reads $[-20, -20]$ for all five conflicts.

\section{Exact Solution of the Delay Only Model}
We want to investigate the influence of departure delay discretization in the delay only model.
Therefore we used a constraint programming solver to solve most of the connected component subsets of the problem.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{pics/totalDelayVsDelayStep_examples.pdf}
    \caption{Influence of the discretization on the solution of the two instances extracted from connected components of the conflict graph}
    \label{fig:totalDelayVsDelayStep}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:totalDelayVsDelayStep} shows the total delay of the solution in dependence of the number of delay steps used.
We can see that a fairly low maximum delay step $d_\text{max}$ is sufficient.
On the other hand, the solutions get better for smaller the delay step sizes $\Delta d$.

\section{Exact Solution of the QUBO Formulation of the Delay Only Model}
The QUBO formulation of the problem requires the reformulation of constraints as additional penalty terms in the objective function.
If these penalty weights are chosen too large the original objective might get suppressed. 
On the other hand, if the penalty weights are too small the resulting solution can become invalid due to non-vanishing penalty terms.
Therefore we investigate the solution to the QUBO formulation of the delay only model checking the validity of the exact solution for various penalty weights.
In the course of this we used an algorithm which tracks the boundary between valid and invalid solutions.
Figure \ref{fig:validityMaps} shows an example for the validity of the solution in dependence of the penalty weights.
In all observed cases there is a box like shape of the validity boundary.
Moreover the validity boundary moves to higher penalty weights for decreasing number of delay steps.
