Participants: Bryan, Salvatore, Tobias

1. Status

 * Salvatore is finishing the informal report
 * Tobias finished some D-Wave runs on real data instances of the departure only model

2. Discussion of Salvatore's plots of the conflict data

3. Discussion about the general strategy for the next weeks
 
 * Bryan suggested the following steps:
   Step back from the D-Wave runs for now and try to isolate the various effects in order:

   1. Effect of discretizing delay times at various resolutions (comparing quality of solution to that of the original continuous problem), using a classical solver and hard constraints.

   2. Softening of constraints, still using a classical solver but exploring how strong the penalty weights need to be for the ground state to be valid.

   3. Using simulated annealing and D-Wave runs, investigating the effect of embedding and precision issues. 

4. Next steps:

 * Salvatore will investigate the influence of discretization in the departure only model with the help of classical solvers.

 * Tobias will try to overcome the precision issues as they occur for the departure delay model in the case of non-trivial number of delay steps.

 * Salvatore and/or Bryan will try to
   1. find a way to exchange large data
   2. find a place to put the minutes
