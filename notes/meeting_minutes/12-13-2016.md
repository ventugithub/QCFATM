ATM meeting 12/13/2016:
----------------------

Participants: Bryan, Salvatore, Tobias

* Tobias checked fixed implementation of the conflict precalculation and showed new plots on
  * Effects of model discretization (contraint programming results)
  * Validity maps for the QUBO formulation of the problem
  * For pairs of flights, gaps in the conflict time intervals
    * Here we should look at the pairs of flights involving more than 1 conflict in real space

* We should make steps towards a model for generating instances
  * Use Mathematica function GeoNearest

* For a meeting with Banavar and colleagues Tobias should prepare some plots showing crossing conflicts in real space

* Next meeting in after new year's eve. Probably in the week from January 16 on. Tobias should be at NASA Ames then.
