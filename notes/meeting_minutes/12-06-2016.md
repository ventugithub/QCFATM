ATM meeting 12/06/2016:
----------------------

Participants: Bryan, Salvatore, Tobias

* After last week's discussion Tobias found an error in the precalculation of the conflicts
  * The error seems fixed but he will run further tests to be sure
  * This means we need to rerun everything
  * As soon as the code is checked, Tobias will tell Salvatore so that he can rerun his analysis on the conflict graphs

* Tobias' conflict plots look right now
  * Bryan suggested to display also the time differences
  * We need to investigate if there are more than one conflict between two flights (apart from departure and arrival conflicts)
  * We saw a plot of two trajectories crossing each other twice. Why is that? We need to ask the ATM people
   
* Discussion on Tobias' results of constraint programming solutions
  * After considering only delay steps which are multiples of the unit of time the plots look like expected
  * Tobias should also plot the total delay versus the delay step size.
    * We expect to curves to collapse to more or less on curve
  * Tobias will also run very small maximum delays
    * The total delay should increase while decreasing the maximum delay
    * Below a certain lower bound for the maximum delay the problem will not be satisfiable
