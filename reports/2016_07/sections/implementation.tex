\section*{Implementation and benchmarks}

In order to optimize our formulation of the problem to realistic data, we focus
on flight data in the North Atlantic oceanic airspace (NAT), for which we have
wind-optimal trajectories for two consecutive days (July
28\textsuperscript{th}-29\textsuperscript{th} 2012) for which state-of-the-art
solutions exist.  The NAT dataset consists of wind-optimal trajectories in
(3+1)-dimensions for 984 flights. 
These trajectories, subsets thereof, and toy-instances based thereon will serve as our benchmark set.

\indent We have already implemented the first step in processing the raw data
into a useful form: given the trajectories, finding the set of potential
conflicts.  Using additional tools also already developed, we are currently
looking closely at these potential conflicts in order to devise
parameterizations and encodings of possible maneuvers that are amenable to a
QUBO formulation.
Importantly, our ASD collaborators have already expressed interest in the visualization tools we have developed, an excellent example of how work such can have benefits beyond quantum annealing.
