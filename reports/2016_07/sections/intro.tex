\section*{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Building on our promising prior results in the planning domain~\cite{rieffel:15,venturelli:15},
we have begun to explore the potential of quantum annealing (QA) for solving challenging computational problems related to air traffic management (ATM)\cite{rodionova:16, rodionova:thesis15}.
This work is being performed by members of the QuAIL team (Tobias Stollenwerk, Bryan O'Gorman, Salvatore Mandr\`a, Davide Venturelli and Eleanor G. Rieffel) with expertise in all aspects of applying quantum annealing to real-world problems, in close collaboration with domain experts in ATM (Olga Rodionova, Hok K. Ng and Banavar Sridhar).
We have identified a specific problem within ATM to serve as a case study, and have made significant progress towards formulating it in a way that is amenable to quantum computing.
See \tablename~\ref{table:milestone} for a complete overview of completed and future milestones.
