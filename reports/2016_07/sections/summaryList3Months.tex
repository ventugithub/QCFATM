    \textbf{Summary of completed tasks (3.5 Months):}
      \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
        \itemsep-0.5em
	\item Identified specific ATM problem, deconflicting trajectories, as case study
        \item Devised code to analyze and visualize wind-optimal trajectories
        \item Identified and characterized all potential conflicts in NAT dataset
        \item Developed formulations of a simpler version of the problem 
with only origination delays, amenable being run on a quantum annealer. Write-up available
        \item Began developing formulations that support manoevers as well
as delays
	\item Identified subsets of data treatable independently, a
first step in the design of a set of small benchmark problems
