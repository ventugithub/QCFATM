    \textbf{Next steps (4 months):}
      \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm] 
        \itemsep-0.5em
        \item Develop a variety of mappings to QUBO of the problem with maneuvers.
        \item Design a set of benchmark ATM problems based on NAT data.
        \item Run state-of-art classical QUBO solvers and
the \DW\ quantum annealer on the benchmark set, and analyze the performance.
	\item Feedback results from these initial runs into proplem parameters and encodings. Design more advanced set of quantum annealing or hybrid 
quantum-classical approaches to these problems
